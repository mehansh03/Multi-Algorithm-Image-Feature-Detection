#  Multi-Algorithm Image Feature Detection

This project explores and compares multiple powerful computer vision techniques for image feature detection and matching. Using algorithms like **SIFT**, **RANSAC**, and **Harris Corner Detection**, it demonstrates how computers analyze and interpret visual information. From identifying keypoints to matching features and filtering mismatches, this project provides a practical insight into how machines "see" the world.

##  Techniques Used

- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**: Detects distinctive keypoints and computes descriptors invariant to scale and rotation.
- **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)**: Filters out mismatched keypoints to estimate a robust transformation model.
- **Harris Corner Detection**: Identifies corners in images by analyzing changes in pixel intensity.
